glyph pixel: 5px*5px

line separators: 2px high, 2px from glyph, 8px from prior line

character spacing: ~5px

word spacers: glyph-scale top and bottom pixels set, spread across width. minimum 1 glyph wide, expand for justification

6 full lines per MC block
line height is 2px + 2px + 2px + 25px + 2px + 2px + 6px = 41px ~= 40px ( we will use 7 pixels [2 + 5] for separator spacing to match 40px exactly)
an MC block is then 40px * 6 = 240px
therefore, 8 glyphs fit horizontally in each block (240 / (5*6))
